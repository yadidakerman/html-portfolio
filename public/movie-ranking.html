<h1>The Best Movies According to Yadid</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>the movie Jurassic Park is one of my favorite movies because of the Breakthrough
of Technology via 3D animation. for the first time in big screen Theater you could 
see a dinosaur that actually looks real and not like pastelina. </p>
<h3>Black hawk down</h3>
<p>Black Hawk Down is one of my favorite movies.
    as a teenager growing up I had a dream of becoming a infantry combat fighter.
    For the first time through the movie I saw the complexity of Modern Warfare of hero
    soldiers trying to kill terrorist while  terrorists are 
    hiding behind civilians and dressed up as 
    civilians. That means a lot of civilians are actually terrorists.
    through this movie I saw the brutality of War.
    The gore of modern time combat, were limbs are flying all over the place.
    Black hawk down movie made me 
    think deeper if I want to be a infantry combat 
    Soldier. I a'm today I'm in my 30 so was I a combat Soldier?</p>
<h3>DragonBall Z Broly</h3>
<p>In my teenage years I loved Dragon Ball Z intill To this day I stil love Dragon Ball Z. 
    Dragon Ball Z helped me in a lot of points in my life. 
    Sometimes in my life I imagine myself turning into a Super Saiyan and it helped me
    to take on the big chalnges that life throws at me. In Dragon Ball Z 
    Broly  Goku fights the Legendary Super Saiyan and he gets the beating of his life but with the help 
    of his  friends he manges to defate the legndery super Saiyan.
    Sometimes they're are stuff you can't do by yourself 
    but with the help of your friends one could be unstoppable. 
    That's why I love this movie.</p>
